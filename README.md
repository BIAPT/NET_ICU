# NET_ICU Pipeline
This repository is for the EEG-based graph theory analysis of the NET_ICU study. The code found here is a work-in progress and not a final implementation. 

Current features are already available

- **Functional connectivity (wPLI) ** : Time-averaged functional connectivity for the different experimental phases
- **Functional connectivity (dPLI) ** : Time-averaged functional connectivity for the different experimental phases
- **Hub ** : Time-averaged functional connectivity for the different experimental phases

Features left to implement

- Spectrogram
- Topographic map 
- Separation into left-right hemisphere
