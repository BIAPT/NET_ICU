# NET_ICU Pipeline
This repository is for the EEG-based graph theory analysis of the NET_ICU study. The code found here is a work-in progress and not a final implementation. 

Requirement to use the pipeline:

- MATLAB version: R2020a or more recent version is required
- Neuroalgo MATLAB functions

Current features are already available

- **Functional connectivity (wPLI) ** : Time-averaged functional connectivity for the different experimental phases
- **Functional connectivity (dPLI) ** : Time-averaged functional connectivity for the different experimental phases
- **Hub ** : Time-averaged functional connectivity for the different experimental phases


- ** Spectrogram : Average frequency of all electrodes
- ** Topographic map : Topographic map of frequency power from 4 to 13 Hz
